In order to build the programs you'll need the following development tools,
libraries and headers for these libraries. The version between parenthesis is
the minimum version actively tested (if differs from the minimum listed
version). The minimum version listed is still the expected minium required
version, but no guarantees.

	cmake >= 2.8.0 (2.8.2)
	g++ (4.4.5) *
	boost (1.42)
	google-glog (0.3.0)
	doxygen >= 1.7.1 **

*) Other compilers should work as well, but have not been tested.
**) Used to generate Doxygen output.
